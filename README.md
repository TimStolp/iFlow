# iFlow

This repository is about reproducing and extending the results presented in the paper "Identifying through Flows for Recovering Latent Representations" by Shen Li et al. and is forked from the original repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/MathsXDC/iFlow).
This is part of the Fairness, Accountability, Confidentiality and Transparency in AI course at the University of Amsterdam. 

The iFlow model aims to recover the true latent variables through the concept of identifiability.
